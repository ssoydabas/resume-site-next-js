      <p className="mb-4">
        I am a self-taught software developer holding a degree in
        English/American Literature.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        While trying to establish an ESL School in my hometown, I was in
        desperate need of a web application that I could promote my school to
        people, however, I have failed to find a developer to build it for me.
        That's when I decided to learn how to code and build it myself. I have
        been coding ever since.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        My school had a success for several years mostly thanks to the web
        application I have built. Then I have decided to be a software
        developer, and software engineer respectively. Working as a freelancer,
        I have completed 2 more projects for local businesses around the globe,
        being in Netherlands and Thailand. I, then, wanted to be involved in
        bigger engineer teams, therefore, I have started working for bigger
        companies.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Nowadays I am looking for another opportunity for myself to grow and use
        my skills to actually have an impact on amazing projects. I am willing
        to learn new technologies if needed. As a fast learner and a good team
        player, I believe onboardings will never be this easy, ever again.
      </p>
      <p>Looking forward to meeting you.</p>
